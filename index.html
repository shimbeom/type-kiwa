  <textarea id="typingCanvas" spellcheck="false" placeholder="  Characterized by its gently curved lines and elegant overhangs, the Kiwa embodies the principles of harmony and balance inherent in Korean design philosophy. Traditionally made from clay tiles, the Kiwa is meticulously crafted by skilled artisans, each tile painstakingly shaped and fired to perfection. One of the most distinctive aspects of the Kiwa is its layered construction, which consists of multiple rows of tiles arranged in a cascading fashion.
  This not only provides protection against the elements but also allows for natural ventilation, helping to regulate temperature and humidity within the building. Beyond its practical function, the Kiwa holds deep symbolic significance in Korean culture. Its graceful curvature is said to represent the gentle embrace of nature, while its upward sweep embodies the aspirations of the Korean people towards prosperity and harmony.
  Moreover, the Kiwa serves as a visual expression of the hierarchical structure inherent in Korean society, with the size and shape of the roof often reflecting the status and importance of the building's occupants. In royal palaces and temples, the Kiwa is often adorned with intricate decorations and ornamental features, further enhancing its grandeur and majesty. Despite the passage of time and the advent of modern architecture, the Kiwa continues to endure as a timeless symbol of Korean identity and heritage. Its graceful silhouette and timeless beauty serve as a reminder of the rich cultural legacy that continues to inspire and captivate people around the world." autofocus></textarea>
